# Traffic Light Routine Prototype

A small, battery-powered **traffic light lamp** modified into a **kids' daily routine indicator**.

The goal of this prototype is to turn an off‑the‑shelf toy traffic light into a **visual readiness system** for children:
- 🟥 **Red** – core tasks not done yet (teeth, clothes, quick tidy)
- 🟨 **Yellow** – almost ready, 1–2 items missing (backpack, water bottle, jacket)
- 🟩 **Green** – fully ready (free play, story time, or leaving the house)

This repository is portfolio evidence of:
- basic **hardware modification** (battery → USB / rechargeable power)
- simple **microcontroller control** for three LEDs
- **UX thinking** around ADHD‑friendly, kid‑friendly routines.

> Note: This is a learning prototype, not a production safety device.
