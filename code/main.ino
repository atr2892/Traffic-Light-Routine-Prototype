/*
  Kids' Traffic Light Routine Prototype
  -------------------------------------
  NOTE ABOUT CODE PROVENANCE

  The original working sketch used for this prototype was assembled
  in a "piecemeal" fashion from multiple public Arduino examples,
  tutorials, and documentation sources (e.g., basic LED blink,
  button input handling, and finite state machine patterns).

  To respect licensing, attribution, and academic integrity, that
  composite sketch is NOT published here verbatim.

  Instead, this file is a placeholder and documentation anchor.
  See CODE_PROVENANCE.md in the repository root for:

    - A description of the external references used
    - How the snippets were combined and adapted
    - What was learned during debugging and refinement
    - Pseudocode for the final behavior

  If you are reviewing this project, please treat this repository
  as evidence of:
    * the ability to research and integrate multiple code sources
    * understanding of the underlying patterns (debouncing, FSM, etc.)
    * honest attribution of non-original code.
