# ⚙️ Hardware Overview  
*A high-level, patent-safe description of the physical system*

---

## 🔌 Hardware Summary  
This prototype repurposes a small children’s traffic-light toy as a **visual indicator system**, using only the **low-voltage side** of the device.  
The original AC-powered components remain untouched, ensuring both safety and compliance.  

This section provides a **public-safe** overview of the hardware concepts explored during prototyping, intentionally omitting enabling details until provisional patent filings are complete.

---

## 🔋 Power System (Generalized & Safe)  
The prototype evaluates multiple **low-voltage DC (LVDC)** power approaches suitable for educational and embedded research:

- Standard battery-based operation  
- USB-based low-voltage power  
- Rechargeable power modules  

These concepts support predictable, safe behavior without specifying circuitry, values, routing, or protected implementation details.

---

## 🧠 Control & Logic Platform (High-Level Only)  
The system may incorporate a small embedded controller to conceptually support:

- interpreting simple user input  
- controlling the indicator lights  
- enabling future IoT or connected behavior  

Controller families considered include common low-voltage development boards used in early embedded-systems learning.  
**No pinouts, wiring diagrams, firmware sequences, or control paths are disclosed**, preserving intellectual property scope.

---

## 🛡️ Safety Principles  
All hardware exploration is guided by:

- exclusive use of **low-voltage DC systems**  
- no modification of AC mains hardware  
- maintained enclosure integrity  
- optional protective modules where appropriate  
- standard insulation and separation practices  

This ensures child-safe operation and supports responsible prototyping.

## 🖼️ Figures & Diagrams  
The `/figures` directory contains **conceptual, abstract diagrams** that illustrate:

- general layout  
- possible component relationships  
- enclosure space usage  

These diagrams are **non-enabling** and intentionally omit any proprietary electrical detail, timing, sequencing, or wiring implementation.

## 📌 Notice  
This hardware description is intentionally general to remain **public-safe** during ongoing provisional patent preparation.  
It does not represent a full disclosure of the invention or its protected implementation.
